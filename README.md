### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Amedeo Majer full stack web development student at Hive Helsinki (part of the 42 network).
I've been learning PHP and MySQL developing a small social media app to share images with stickers called <a href="https://github.com/amedeomajer/camagru" >camagru</a>.
At the moment I'm learning React and node.js while developing a dating web app called <a href="https://github.com/amedeomajer/Matcha_Hive" >matcha</a>,
this is being so far the most challenging project because of the complexity that javaScript is bringing to the table compared to just PHP, HTML, CSS and vanilla js.
I'm planning to introduce myself to TypeScript during this project and for the future I'm interested in learning GrapgQl, Redux and some cloud cloud computing service.
